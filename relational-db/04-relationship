One to Many Relationships 
means that one row in one table can be related to many rows in another table at the other side of the relationship, but not vice versa.

Many to Many relationships 
means that a record in one table can relate to many other records in another table, and one record from the second table can also relate back to many records in the first table.

A “One to one” relationship 
between two tables means that a row in one table can only relate to one row in the table on the other side of their relationship and vice versa. 
This is the least common database relationship.

The models that database designers create are called Entity Relationship Diagrams, because they are intended to model the way tables will eventually relate to each other in the finished database.
