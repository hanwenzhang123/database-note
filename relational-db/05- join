JOIN
- combine data from two or more tables

A join is the instruction to the query engine on how to relate records in one table to records in another.

INNER JOINs are the backbone of advanced SQL querying. There are literally thousands of books, articles and blog posts with examples and information about SQL joins.
- return only the data that exists in both tables

Three Types of Outer Joins:
Left - the one you selected go first
Right
Full

SELECT <columns>
FROM <table1>
LEFT JOIN <table2> ON <equality criteria>
INNER JOIN <table3> ON <equality criteria>
WHERE <search criteria>


A left outer join returns all data from the first -- or left -- table and only the data with matches in the second table.

What is a JOIN?
It is how a SQL query combines data from two tables into one result set.

Where does the INNER JOIN clause go in a SQL statement?
After FROM clause but before WHERE clause
