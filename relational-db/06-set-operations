set operations
- combine or limit results using two or more datasets

union - stack together, need same column
union all - everything 
intersect - only return the value exist both
except - only the record that is not matched in latter table


Union and Union All combine data from multiple tables into one result set.
Intersect produces a result set from values of rows that's are in common between both tables.
Except produces a result set of values of rows that exist in the first table, but not the second.


UNION - <query 1> UNION <query 2>
Use to combine two data sets into one, stacked one on top of the other, unlike an inner join which puts data together side by side.

SEELECT MakeName FROM Make UNION SELECT MakeName FROM ForeignMake;

SEELECT MakeID, MakeName FROM Make UNION SELECT ForeignMakeID, MakeName FROM ForeignMake;

Union statement returns a distinct set based on the column specified so the ID can be the same but with a different MakeName here.


UNION ALL - <query 1> UNION ALL <query 2>
It is almost the same as UNION, but will not eliminate duplicates. 
It will return all the value even it is duplicates


INTERSECT - <query 1> INTERSECT <query 2>
It is similar to an Inner Join. As with a UNION, they must have the same columns in both the left and right side of the SQL operation.


EXCEPT - <query 1> EXCEPT <query 2>
It uses the same format as INTERSECT, but outputs only the records that are not in the latter table.
