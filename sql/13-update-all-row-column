Update All Rows or Columns in a Table

set all last name to anonymous
UPDATE patrons SET last_name = anonymous;

set all email and zipcode as the same
UDPATE patrons SET email = anon@email.com, zipcode = 123;



An update statement for all rows:
UPDATE <table> SET <column> = <value>;

The = sign is different from an equality operator from a WHERE condition. 
It's an assignment operator because you're assigning a new value to something.

Examples:
UPDATE users SET password = "thisisabadidea";
UPDATE products SET price = 2.99;

Update multiple columns in all rows:
UDPATE <table> SET <column 1> = <value 1>, <column 2> = <value 2>;

Examples:
UPDATE users SET first_name = "Anony", last_name = "Moose";
UPDATE products SET stock_count = 0, price = 0;
