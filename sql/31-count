Counting the number of rows is great for answering questions such as "How many users do we have?" and "How many sales happened this week?".

To count rows you can use the COUNT() function.
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <table>;

To count unique entries use the DISTINCT keyword too:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT <column>) FROM <table>;

count()
- total number of rows
- results of a query
- distinct entries
- aggregates


Only count non-null values

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products where category = 'Clothing';

SELECT DISTINCT category FROM products; //select all the unique ones
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT category) FROM products;  //count all the unique ones
