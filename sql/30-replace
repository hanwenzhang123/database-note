Replacing parts of text is handy for privacy concerns, standardization or improving output.


To replace piece of strings of text in a larger body of text you can use the REPLACE() function.

SELECT REPLACE(<original value or column>, <target string>, <replacement string>) FROM <table>;


REPLACE(state, 'California', 'CA'); 

SELECT * FROM adddresses      //search all the addresses in CA no matter how we entered it
WHERE REPLACE(state, 'California', 'CA') = 'CA'

SELECT street, city, REPLACE(state, 'California', 'CA'), zip FROM adddresses      //formatting to CA
WHERE REPLACE(state, 'California', 'CA') = 'CA'



What is the correct way of using the REPLACE() function for replacing "javascript" with "JavaScript" ?
SELECT REPLACE("I can't capitalize javascript correctly!", "javascript", "JavaScript");
