SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'placed' AND ordered_on = DATE('now')   //get all the today's orders

If today was the 8th July 2018, how would I write that date in SQLite/SQL Playground?
'2018-07-08'

SQLite
To get the current date use: DATE("now")    //today's date

To get the current time use: TIME("now")

To get the current date time: DATETIME("NOW")



MS SQL
To get the current date use: CONVERT(date, GETDATE())

To get the current time use: CONVERT(time, GETDATE())

To get the current date time: GETDATE()



MySQL
To get the current date use: CURDATE()

To get the current time use: CURTIME()

To get the current date time: NOW()



Oracle and PostgreSQL
To get the current date use: CURRENT_DATE

To get the current time use: CURRENT_TIME

To get the current date time: `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
