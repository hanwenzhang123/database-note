Ordering by a single column criteria:
SELECT * FROM <table name> ORDER BY <column> [ASC|DESC];

ASC is used to order results in ascending order. small to big
DESC is used to order results in descending order. big to small


Examples:

SELECT * FROM books ORDER BY title ASC;
SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = "Sonic T-Shirt" ORDER BY stock_count DESC;
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY signed_up_on DESC;
SELECT * FROM countries ORDER BY population DESC;
Ordering by multiple column criteria:
SELECT * FROM <table name> ORDER BY <column> [ASC|DESC],
                                    <column 2> [ASC|DESC],
                                    ...,
                                    <column n> [ASC|DESC];
Ordering is prioritized left to right.

Examples:

SELECT * FROM books ORDER BY    genre ASC, 
                                title ASC;

SELECT * FROM books ORDER BY    genre ASC,
                                year_published DESC;

SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY    last_name ASC,
                                first_name ASC;
