Ordering by a single column criteria:
SELECT * FROM <table name> ORDER BY <column> [ASC|DESC];

ASC is used to order results in ascending order. small to big
DESC is used to order results in descending order. big to small

The DESC keyword is used after the ORDER BY clause to order dates from the most recent to the furthest back in time.

ASC - order from lowest to highest alphabetically or numerically, or oldest time to newest time
DESC - vice versa

Examples:

SELECT * FROM books ORDER BY title ASC;
SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = "Sonic T-Shirt" ORDER BY stock_count DESC;
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY signed_up_on DESC;
SELECT * FROM countries ORDER BY population DESC;
Ordering by multiple column criteria:
SELECT * FROM <table name> ORDER BY <column> [ASC|DESC],
                                    <column 2> [ASC|DESC],
                                    ...,
                                    <column n> [ASC|DESC];
Ordering is prioritized left to right.

Examples:

SELECT * FROM books ORDER BY    genre ASC, 
                                title ASC;

SELECT * FROM books ORDER BY    genre ASC,
                                year_published DESC;

SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY    last_name ASC,
                                first_name ASC;
