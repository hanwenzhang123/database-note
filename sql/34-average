Averages are great for calculating averages of scores, reviews and sales.


To get the average value of a numeric column use the AVG() function.

SELECT AVG(<numeric column>) FROM <table>;
SELECT AVG(<numeric column>) FROM <table> GROUP BY <other column>;
 
 
What function would I use in conjunction with AVG() to fix any remainders after the decimal place?
ROUND();
