Itâ€™s often handy to group rows together to count them. For example you could answer the question "How many books are in each genre?"


To count aggregated rows with common values use the GROUP BY keywords:

SELECT COUNT(<column>) FROM <table> GROUP BY <column with common value>;


GROUP BY vs DISTINCT
distinct - duplicate ones
group - group rows together so you can use functions like counts


SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS "product count" FROM products GROUP BY category;

Think of a fruit basket filled with mango, pineapples, and bananas. 
Now you want to count how many mango, pineapples, and bananas you have, because you feel like having a smoothie party. 
You would do this by separating or GROUPing each piece of fruit to count how many you have. 
In this case you have 9 bananas, 2 pineapples, and 3 mango. Time for delicious smoothies!
