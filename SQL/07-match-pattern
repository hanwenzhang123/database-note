LIKE
similar to a certain message, case insensitive, need the wildcard %
SELECT title FROM books WHERE title = "Harry Potter" - this is a straight match
SELECT title FROM books WHERE title LIKE "Harry Potter%" - this looks for pattern

"Harry Potter%" - start with the pattern Harry Potter
"%Harry Potter" - if it is just Martian or The Martian

Placing the percent symbol (%) any where in a string in conjunction with the LIKE keyword will operate as a wildcard. 
A wildcard % is a substiute character used when you don't know the rest of the text, it can be placed anywhere to find anything
Meaning it can be substituted by any number of characters, including zero!

SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column> LIKE <pattern>;

Examples:
SELECT title FROM books WHERE title LIKE "Harry Potter%Fire";
SELECT title FROM movies WHERE title LIKE "Alien%";
SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE first_name LIKE "%drew";
SELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE "%Brief History%";

PostgreSQL Specific Keywords
LIKE in PostgreSQL is case-sensitive. To case-insensitive searches do ILIKE.

SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE first_name ILIKE "%drew";
