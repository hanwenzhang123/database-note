Databases with Frameworks
Many developers, while using databases, aren't required to write a single line of SQL code. They use special software libraries called ORMs

ORM - Object-Relational Mapping â€“ used to perform CRUD operations with a language other than SQL.
DML - Data Manipulation Language - the subset of the SQL programming language that deals with CRUD operations.

Examples of ORMs:
Hibernate for Java
CoreData for Objective-C or Swift
Django ORM for Python
ActiveRecord for Ruby
