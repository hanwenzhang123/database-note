Change title name with AS, without AS also works but just not clear

Aliasing with Single Word
SELECT title AS Title FROM books;

Aliasing with Multiple Words
SELECT title AS Title, first_published AS "First Published" FROM books;

use "" for string value, due to the space, withouut "", it will get syntax error


SELECT <column name> AS <alias> FROM <table name>;
SELECT <column name> <alias> FROM <table name>;

SELECT username AS Username, first_name AS "First Name" FROM users;
SELECT title AS Title, year AS "Year Released" FROM movies;
SELECT name AS Name, description AS Description, price AS "Current Price" FROM products;
SELECT name Name, description Description, price "Current Price" FROM
