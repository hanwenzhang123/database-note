Filtering Out or Finding Missing Information

SELECT * FROM loans WHERE return_by > "2015-12-18" AND returned_on IS NULL


When we use NULL we can not use =

to search for missing value only
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column> is NULL;

to filter out missing values
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column> is NOT NULL;
