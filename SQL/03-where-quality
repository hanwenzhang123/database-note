Searching matched value

A WHERE Clause
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <condition> - <column> <operator> <value>

SELECT title, author FROM boooks WHERE first_published = 1997;
SELECT title, first_published FROM boooks WHERE author = 'J.K. Rowling';



Equality Operator
Find all rows that a given value matches a column's value.
 = ' ' case sensitive
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> = <value>;

Examples:

SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE first_name = "Andrew";
SELECT first_name, email FROM users WHERE last_name = "Chalkley";
SELECT name AS "Product Name" FROM products WHERE stock_count = 0;
SELECT title "Book Title" FROM books WHERE year_published = 1999;



Inequality Operator !=
Find all rows that a given value doesn't match a column's value.
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> != <value>;
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> <> <value>;
The not equal to or inequality operator can be written in two ways != and <>. The latter is less common.

Examples:

SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE first_name != "Kenneth";
SELECT first_name, email FROM users WHERE last_name != "L:one";
SELECT name AS "Product Name" FROM products WHERE stock_count != 0;
SELECT title "Book Title" FROM books WHERE year_published != 2015;
